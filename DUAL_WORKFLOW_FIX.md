# ðŸ”§ DUAL WORKFLOW ISSUE - RESOLVED

## ðŸš¨ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**

**2 GitHub Actions were running simultaneously on every push:**

1. **`deploy.yml`** (Legacy) - "ðŸš€ Simple Deploy (Legacy)"
2. **`cpanel-deploy.yml`** (Current) - "ðŸš€ Deploy CharlitexMobileConnect to cPanel"

Both had: `on: push: branches: [main, master]`

## âš¡ **ISSUES CAUSED:**

1. **Resource Waste**: Double CI/CD execution
2. **Conflicts**: Two deployments trying to upload simultaneously  
3. **Debugging Confusion**: Which workflow was actually working?
4. **Potential Interference**: One workflow might override the other's deployment

## âœ… **SOLUTION APPLIED:**

### Legacy Workflow Disabled:
```yaml
# Before:
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  workflow_dispatch:

# After:  
on:
  # push:
  #   branches: [main, master]  # DISABLED - Using cpanel-deploy.yml instead
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual trigger only
```

### Result:
- âœ… **Only 1 workflow** runs on push (cpanel-deploy.yml)
- âœ… **Legacy workflow** available for manual testing if needed
- âœ… **No more conflicts** or duplicate deployments
- âœ… **Cleaner CI/CD process**

## ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT DEPLOYMENT:**

The next push will trigger **only the main workflow** with all our fixes:
- âœ… FTP protocol (not SFTP)
- âœ… Production environment secrets
- âœ… Proper Supabase environment variables
- âœ… No workflow conflicts

This should resolve both the dual workflow issue AND potentially the Supabase environment variable problem if it was caused by workflow interference.
