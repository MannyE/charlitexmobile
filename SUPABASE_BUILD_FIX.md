# 🔧 SUPABASE BUILD FIX - Environment Variables Missing in Production

## ✅ **DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE**

### **Problem Confirmed:**
- **Local Build**: Environment variables work perfectly ✅
- **Production Build**: Environment variables missing ❌

### **Root Cause:**
The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is **not passing environment variables** to the `npm run build:prod` step properly.

## 🔍 **Evidence:**

### Local Build Success:
```bash
npm run build:prod
# ✅ Built successfully
# ✅ Supabase URL embedded in: dist/assets/supabase-DRBqLzPs.js
# ✅ Environment variables properly included
```

### Production Build Issue:
- Website shows: `Uncaught Error: Missing Supabase environment variables`
- This means the build is running without the `VITE_*` variables

## 🚀 **SOLUTION:**

The fix I applied should have worked, but let me verify the current workflow and potentially improve it.

### Current Status:
1. **Environment Variables**: ✅ Added to GitHub Secrets (production environment)
2. **Build Step**: ✅ Should have env block with variables
3. **Protocol**: ✅ Fixed to use FTP
4. **Environment**: ✅ Fixed to use production environment

### Potential Issues:
1. **GitHub Actions might not be using latest workflow**
2. **Environment variables might not be accessible in build context**
3. **Build step might need explicit variable passing**

## 📋 **Next Steps:**

1. **Force workflow refresh** by pushing new changes
2. **Verify build step** has explicit environment variables
3. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for environment variable passing
4. **Test deployment** with updated configuration

## 🎯 **Expected Fix:**
After the next deployment, the production build should include Supabase environment variables and the website should work correctly.

## 🔍 **Verification:**
Once deployed, we can verify the fix by:
1. Checking if the website loads without errors
2. Confirming Supabase connection works
3. Testing the waitlist form functionality
