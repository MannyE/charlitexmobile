# 🎯 Environment Configuration Fix

## Issue

Pipeline was deploying to "Configure FTP" environment but secrets are in "production" environment.

## Root Cause

I had previously changed the default environment from "production" to "Configure FTP" when you initially added secrets there. But you've since moved secrets to "production".

## ✅ Solution Applied

```yaml
# Fixed in .github/workflows/cpanel-deploy.yml
environment: ${{ inputs.environment || 'production' }}
```

## 🔍 Environment Hierarchy

Your GitHub setup:

```
Repository Secrets (Available everywhere)
├── Or Environment-Specific Secrets:
    ├── production ✅ (Where your secrets are now)
    └── Configure FTP (Old location)
```

## 🚀 What Happens Now

1. **Pipeline defaults to "production" environment**
2. **Finds your secrets in production environment**
3. **Pre-deployment checks pass**
4. **Deployment proceeds successfully**

## 🎯 Verification

After pushing, you should see:

```
🔍 Pre-deployment checks...
✅ Pre-deployment verification passed
📊 Build info: Size: ~390KB, Files: 8 files
🚀 Deploy to cPanel via SFTP
✅ Deployment completed successfully!
```

## 📋 Current Configuration

- **Environment**: production (default)
- **Protocol**: SFTP (port 22)
- **Directory**: /public_html/
- **Secrets**: All 6 configured in production environment

## ⚡ Ready to Deploy

The pipeline now correctly targets your production environment where all secrets are configured.
