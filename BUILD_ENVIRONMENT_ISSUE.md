# 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Build Step Missing Environment Context

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**

The **build step** doesn't have access to environment secrets because it's **NOT running in the environment context**.

### **Current Configuration:**
```yaml
# ❌ BUILD STEP (Line ~96-140)
build-production:
  name: 🏗️ Production Build
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  # ❌ NO ENVIRONMENT SPECIFIED - Can't access environment secrets!
  
  steps:
    - name: 🏗️ Build for Production
      env:
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.VITE_SUPABASE_URL }}     # ❌ FAILS - No environment context
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}  # ❌ FAILS
        VITE_APP_URL: ${{ secrets.VITE_APP_URL }}               # ❌ FAILS

# ✅ DEPLOY STEP (Line ~190-194) 
deploy-cpanel:
  name: 🌐 Deploy to cPanel
  environment: ${{ inputs.environment || 'production' }}      # ✅ HAS environment context
```

## 🛠️ **THE FIX:**

### **Option 1: Add Environment to Build Step**
```yaml
build-production:
  name: 🏗️ Production Build
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: production  # ✅ ADD THIS LINE
```

### **Option 2: Move Secrets to Repository Level**
Move secrets from Environment to Repository level, but this is less secure.

## 🎯 **WHY THIS HAPPENS:**

1. **Environment Secrets**: Only accessible within jobs that specify `environment: production`
2. **Build Step**: Runs without environment context
3. **Deploy Step**: Has environment context but doesn't need the build variables
4. **Result**: Build runs without Supabase variables, deploy gets built files without variables

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:**

Add `environment: production` to the build-production job so it can access the environment secrets.
